1. Case Background
The primary objective of this report is to forecast the sales of individual product types within each ABC store for the period spanning from July 31, 2017, to August 15, 2017.

ABC is a prominent South America-based grocery retailer currently relying on subjective forecasting techniques for sales predictions.

To forecast the sales of the desired period, we had access to an ABC store dataset that encompassed essential sales data for 33 distinct product types across 54 stores, spanning from
01/01/2013 to 15/08/2017.

We will achieve our goal by first doing a comprehensive analysis of the data, ensuring data coherence, and handling outliers, to determine sales patterns. Subsequently, we will use this information to employ feature engineering techniques to select essential features
correlated with sales predictions therefore setting the stage for modelling.

Then with this information we will employ machine learning models that will compare one against another to identify the most accurate and reliable model for sales prediction within our specified timeframe. 

The selected model will generate information that will enable ABC to consistently meet their customersâ€™ demands by maintaining optimal inventory levels of the products at the right time.
